                <h2>Hello! We are Laura Eng and Tracy Wong of "dew" (Designed by Eng and Wong). We are an alumni and current Stevens student with a love for Chinatown. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, many small businesses are suffering financially and are in danger of shutting down. These businesses have been staples in the community for many years and shape what you and I know as "NYC's Chinatown" today.
                    <br>
                    With some time on our hands and some ideas in our heads, we decided to design some stickers to raise money for this cause. The stickers have a "bakery theme" and incorporate some of our favorite pastries from childhood... with a little twist! Our goal is not only to help these businesses stay afloat, but also to spread a little positivity in the communityüíï. All proceeds will be going to AAFE's Emergency Small Business Relief Fund (click here to learn more: https://www.aafe.org/small-business-fund). </h2>
