            <h2>Hello! We are Laura Eng and Tracy Wong of "dew" (Designed by Eng and Wong). We are an alumni and current Stevens student with a love for Chinatown. Due to the outbreak of COVID-19, many small businesses are suffering financially and are in danger of shutting down. These businesses have been staples in the community for many years and shape what you and I know as "NYC's Chinatown" today.

                With some time on our hands and some ideas in our heads, we decided to design some stickers to raise money for this cause. The stickers have a "bakery theme" and incorporate some of our favorite pastries from childhood... with a little twist! Our goal is not only to help these businesses stay afloat, but also to spread a little positivity in the community💕. All proceeds will be going to AAFE's Emergency Small Business Relief Fund (click here to learn more: https://www.aafe.org/small-business-fund). </h2>
